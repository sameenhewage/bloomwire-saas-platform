# Bloomwire Change Log

Docs-first change log for **Bloomwire-owned** changes. The full implementation reference lives in
[`implementation-ledger.md`](./implementation-ledger.md); the rule that keeps this file current is
`AGENTS.md` → **"Bloomwire Documentation Governance"** (introduced in Phase 15E.1).

Every entry should record: **phase · PR · merge SHA (once known) · summary · why · what was NOT
changed · validation · residual risks**, and (for security/permission/WhatsApp changes) state
explicitly: **no secrets exposed · no provider-credential mutation unless authorized · whether live
Meta/WhatsApp calls were made · whether Enterprise code was touched.**

## Unreleased / Pending Merge

### Phase 15G.1 — Fix false-success dev deploy (stdin-consumed deploy script)
- **PR:** _pending_
- **Merge SHA:** _pending merge_
- **Type:** CI/CD bugfix (infra-only; no application runtime code)
- **Summary:** The manual Dev/Staging deploy could report **success while leaving the app on the OLD build**.
  `deploy-remote.sh` is piped to the server via `ssh … bash -s`, and `docker compose run --rm rails db:migrate`
  attached **stdin** — so it **consumed the rest of the piped script**. After `db:migrate`, bash hit EOF and
  exited `0`, silently skipping **step 4 (recreate rails+sidekiq)**, **step 5 (smoke: health + SHA verify)**, and
  step 6. The migration applied, but the running containers were never swapped and the smoke checks never ran.
- **Fix (one line):** `… run --rm -T rails bundle exec rails db:migrate </dev/null` — `-T` disables stdin/TTY
  attach and `</dev/null` guarantees the command cannot read the piped script. (`up -d` is detached and the
  smoke `exec -T` was already safe; this was the only `compose run`.)
- **Why it matters:** prevents a false-positive deploy where dev silently runs stale code; smoke now actually
  gates success (health 200 + in-container `/app/.git_sha` == target SHA).
- **Observed once on dev:** deploy of `version_1` (`3bf260f`) created the `bloomwire_email_delivery_logs` table
  but left `app-rails-1` on `fdf94d8`; caught by independent `/app/.git_sha` verification. A corrected re-deploy
  is required to actually run `3bf260f` (migration is idempotent; no rollback needed — additive table).
- **Not changed:** no application code, no migrations, no compose files, no `.env`, no secrets, no production
  path. Postgres/redis volumes untouched.
- **Security:** no secrets read or printed; no live Meta/WhatsApp calls; Enterprise untouched.
- **Validation:** `bash -n .github/scripts/deploy-remote.sh` OK; PR CI green (see PR). Runtime re-deploy is
  gated on review/merge (not performed in this PR).
- **Deploy required:** Yes — after merge, re-run Deploy Dev/Staging (`dev`, `version_1`, `run_migrations=true`).

### Phase 15F.1 — Send-from-Template composer (owner-only)
- **PR:** _pending_
- **Merge SHA:** _pending merge_
- **Type:** Feature (SuperAdmin / Bloomwire owner console; builds on Phase 15F)
- **Summary:** Added an owner-only **"Send from Template"** composer on the Email Templates tab. Discovery
  confirmed the prior "Send Test Email" button only linked to the Test Email tab (a generic sample send) — there
  was no way to fill template variables and send the rendered template. The composer exposes 9 fields (recipient,
  the 6 `{{variables}}`, plus button label/link), an **"Update preview"** round-trip that renders the final
  branded email with the entered values, and a **"Send Email"** action.
- **Review fix pass (this PR):**
  - **Delivered email now matches the preview.** A single shared partial
    (`app/views/bloomwire/email/_branded_email.html.erb`) is rendered by BOTH the composer preview AND the
    mailer, so they cannot drift. The mailer's new `template_email` sends **multipart HTML + plain-text** — the
    HTML carries the branding, CTA **button**, and footer; the text part is a fallback with the same key values.
    Placeholders are interpolated before sending; no raw `{{...}}` remains for supplied values.
  - **Per-send Email Logs.** New Bloomwire-owned table `bloomwire_email_delivery_logs` + model; every template
    send writes one row (**success / failed / blocked**) with recipient, template, status, timestamp, actor, and
    a **sanitized** error. The Email Logs tab now shows these rows (plus the latest test-email result).
  - New `Bloomwire::SendTemplateEmailService` owns the template send (preflight + enabled-gate + logging);
    `SendTestEmailService` was reverted to its original Test-Email-only role. Preflight + secret-filtering are
    now centralized on `Bloomwire::EmailSetting` (`block_reason` + `sanitize_secret`).
- **Why:** Owners need to send a real, variable-filled, on-brand email from a chosen template and audit each
  send — ahead of Phase 16 onboarding emails.
- **Honesty / safety:** Preflight + **enabled-gated** — blocks honestly (and records a `blocked` log) when the
  recipient is blank, SMTP is incomplete, or outbound email is disabled; **never fakes success**; the Send button
  is disabled until SMTP is ready. The SMTP password is never rendered, logged, or stored (errors sanitized).
- **Access:** owner-only via the existing `Bloomwire::RequiresPlatformOwner` gate on both controllers; non-owner
  platform admins and customer/business users are blocked (send + Email Logs).
- **Not changed:** no WhatsApp/Meta/provider credentials or code, no Enterprise code, no `BusinessOwner` role, no
  `users.type` for business roles, no chat/message tables, Devise/password-reset mailers untouched, no new
  dependencies, no production deploy.
- **Security:** no secrets exposed · no provider-credential mutation · **no** live Meta/WhatsApp calls (mailer
  stubbed on delivery paths; the suite makes no real SMTP connection) · Enterprise code untouched · the new log
  table never stores credentials and only stores sanitized errors.
- **Validation:** RuboCop clean on all changed Ruby; **71 examples, 0 failures** for the Bloomwire email suite,
  including: owner can send (→ success log) · non-owner blocked (send + logs) · missing recipient → blocked log ·
  incomplete SMTP → blocked log · disabled SMTP → blocked log · failed send → failed log with sanitized error ·
  HTML **and** text parts contain replaced values + CTA, no raw `{{...}}` · Email Logs renders recipient/template/
  status · password never in logs/response/HTML · final-preview round-trip uses the shared branded shell.
- **Residual:** SMTP password remains plaintext-at-rest (documented Phase 15F debt, encryption still parked);
  Office365 SMTP AUTH may still be blocked by tenant Security Defaults (a Microsoft-365 config matter, not code).
- **Migration:** `20260629000003_create_bloomwire_email_delivery_logs` (additive; new Bloomwire-owned table).
- **Runtime impact:** new owner-only UI action + new table · **Deploy required:** Yes — run the migration
  (after review/merge; not done here).

### Phase 15G — CI/CD Foundation (PR CI + manual Dev/Staging deploy)
- **PR:** _pending_
- **Merge SHA:** _pending merge_
- **Type:** CI/CD / process (infra-only; no application runtime code)
- **Summary:** Added repo-root GitHub Actions. `ci.yml` validates PRs targeting `version_1` — RuboCop,
  ESLint, Vitest, Vite asset build (`assets:precompile`), a curated Bloomwire RSpec suite (52 spec files)
  on ephemeral Postgres+Redis, a migration/schema-sync check, a docs-governance check, and a
  self-contained basic secret scan. `deploy-dev.yml` is a manual (`workflow_dispatch`) Dev/Staging deploy
  over SSH that builds the image with the exact `GIT_SHA`, optionally migrates, recreates only
  `rails`+`sidekiq` (`--no-deps`, preserving postgres/redis volumes), and runs post-deploy smoke
  (health 200, in-container SHA match, postgres/redis still Up). Remote logic lives in
  `.github/scripts/deploy-remote.sh`; full guide in [`deployment-runbook.md`](./deployment-runbook.md).
- **Why:** Safer, auditable, less-manual dev/staging deploys and consistent PR gating before Phase 16.
- **Runner:** GitHub-hosted only (Option A). No self-hosted runner this phase.
- **Not changed:** no application runtime code, no migrations, no Enterprise code, no provider/credentials,
  no production deploy path, no Docker/compose files, no `.env`. The server-local
  `docker-compose.bloomwire-production.yaml` overlay is untouched (gitignored).
- **Security:** CI reads **no** secrets and makes **no** live Meta/WhatsApp calls (specs WebMock-blocked);
  deploy credentials are per-environment GitHub Environment secrets, never printed; the SSH key is written
  `600` and removed after the run; Postgres/Redis volumes are never destroyed.
- **Validation:** YAML parse OK (`ci.yml` 8 jobs, `deploy-dev.yml` 1 job); all embedded shell + the remote
  script pass `bash -n`; the Bloomwire spec selector resolves to 52 files. Live CI/deploy runs happen on the
  PR / on first manual dispatch (after secrets are configured).
- **Residual:** `dev`/`staging` GitHub Environments + SSH secrets must be configured before the deploy
  workflow can run; `actionlint`/`shellcheck` were not available locally (validated via YAML parse + `bash -n`).
- **Runtime impact:** None (infra/docs only) · **Deploy required:** No (it enables deploys; it does not perform one).

### Phase 15F — Owner-only Email Settings (DB-backed SMTP + templates)
- **PR:** #78
- **Merge SHA:** _pending merge_
- **Type:** Feature (SuperAdmin / Bloomwire owner console)
- **Summary:** Added an owner-only `Bloomwire → Email Settings` page (Overview / Configuration /
  Email Templates / Test Email / Email Logs) inside the existing SuperAdmin shell. Two Bloomwire-owned
  tables: `bloomwire_email_settings` (DB-backed SMTP config; ENV `SMTP_*` only as bootstrap defaults) and
  `bloomwire_email_templates` (6 seeded system templates with `{{variable}}` preview + create / edit /
  duplicate / deactivate / reactivate). Preflight-validated Test Email (real send when complete, honest
  "blocked" otherwise — never fakes success).
- **Why:** Phase 16 onboarding needs configurable outbound email + reusable transactional templates owned
  by the Bloomwire Platform Owner.
- **Access:** owner-only (`Bloomwire::PlatformAdmin` active owners); platform admin/support + customer/
  business users blocked; `/super_admin` boundary unchanged.
- **Not changed:** no WhatsApp/Meta/provider credentials, no Enterprise code, no `BusinessOwner` role, no
  `users.type` for business roles, no chat/message tables, Devise/password-reset mailers untouched.
- **Validation:** model + service + mailer + request specs (52 examples, 0 failures); RuboCop clean;
  existing SuperAdmin specs regression-green (39/0). Browser QA on dev pending (post-approval).
- **Review fixes (post-#78 review):** (1) Overview tab copy made honest — it no longer implies password
  resets/transactional emails already use the DB-backed SMTP; it states Devise/password-reset is unchanged
  and transactional sending is parked. (2) System-template **keys are immutable** — `:key` is not permitted
  on update and a model validation blocks changing a system template's key (future routing depends on stable
  keys); keys are auto-generated on create. (3) CTA URL scheme validation (http/https or `{{placeholder}}`
  only) — closes the previously-flagged non-blocking CTA href concern.
- **Security:** SMTP password is **write-only** in the UI (masked, never rendered/logged/printed). No live
  Meta/WhatsApp calls (tests never send real mail). No provider-credential mutation. No Enterprise touched.
- **Residual / SECURITY DEBT:** `smtp_password` is stored **plaintext** in DB because Active Record
  encryption is not configured on this install. **Encryption-at-rest is a parked Phase 15F follow-up.**
  Also parked: transactional wiring of business-invitation/welcome/plan-change/receipt/ticket mailers to
  the DB-backed config; per-message delivery logging (Email Logs shows the last test result only).
- **Runtime impact:** New owner-only page + 2 new tables (migration). **Deploy required:** Yes (after approval).

### Phase 15E.1 — Documentation Governance Guardrail
- **PR:** #77 (docs-only; amends the Phase 15E PR)
- **Type:** Docs / process
- **Summary:** Added a mandatory **Bloomwire Documentation Governance** rule to `AGENTS.md` and
  `CLAUDE.md`, a **Documentation Governance** section (§10) + Definition of Done to the implementation
  ledger (`.md` + `.html`), and created this change log.
- **Why:** Every Bloomwire-owned change must stay transparent and documented; future agents must not
  make hidden/undocumented changes.
- **Not changed:** no runtime application code, no migrations, no Enterprise, no provider/credentials.
- **Validation:** docs-only diff; HTML self-contained + well-formed; ledger and changelog agree.
- **Residual:** none.
- **Runtime impact:** None · **Deploy required:** No

### Phase 15E — Implementation Ledger
- **PR:** #77
- **Type:** Docs
- **Summary:** Added the Bloomwire Implementation Ledger (`docs/bloomwire/implementation-ledger.md`
  + `.html`): ownership, stable baseline, phase-by-phase log (13B–15D), permission model, WhatsApp
  architecture, OSS/Enterprise stance, intentionally-not-changed list, parked/residual items,
  operational rules.
- **Why:** A clear internal reference before Phase 16 customer onboarding.
- **Baseline documented:** `4084a23eb4a83b1ee41e298811a91d52d6fb6044` (after Phase 15C).
- **Not changed:** no runtime application code, no migrations, no Enterprise, no provider/credentials.
- **Validation:** docs-only diff; HTML self-contained (no CDN/JS).
- **Residual:** none.
- **Runtime impact:** None · **Deploy required:** No
